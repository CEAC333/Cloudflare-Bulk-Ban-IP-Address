# Cloudflare IP Address Banning

*WARNING:* Do not use this script unless you know exactly what it does! It is just a rough sketch that isn't finished.

## About

This simple Python 3 script bans spammer IP addresses in bulk. It was written on Ubuntu 14.10.

It reads from a text file that contains a list of IP addresses, one per line. It logs results to a text file.

For now, this is just designed to bulk-ban IP addresses on Cloudflare. Maybe later it will have more functionality.
